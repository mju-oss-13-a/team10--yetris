/** @file globals.h
 * Definitions of global variables that will rule the game.
 *
 * I know it's ugly to leave so many global variables >_<
 *
 * HOW-TO add customization
 * 1- decide what it does on the game
 * 2- make a global in globals.h that defines it
 * 3- initialize it on globals.c -> new_globals() with default value
 * 4- put it on config.c -> config_parse()
 * 5- put it on config.c -> config_create_default() with default value
 * 6- finally, make use of it on the game
 * 7- dont forget to:
 *	  put it on arguments.c -> args_handle() and print_usage()
 *	  put it on the man page
