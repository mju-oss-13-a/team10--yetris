1) Introduction
---------------
yetris is a customizable Tetris(tm) clone for the console.
It aims to follow modern implementations with lots of features
and please both casual players and Tetris(tm) enthusiasts.

It has full textual interface, with colors and many features:
	* Customizable by commandline arguments and config file.
	* High score.
	* Up to 6 next pieces.
	* Hold, Combo and back-to-back sequences.
	* Scoring system compliant to the (conjectured) Tetris(tm) Guideline.

yetris is developed on C and ncurses, running on (most) Linux terminals.
It currently lacks some expected features but is on active development.

Also, the source code is clean and commented, allowing much better
understanding and easing feature-implementation.
